## About Me

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. I study firn processes on the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets and am interested in better understanding the interactions between the atmosphere and the surface of ice sheets. My main tool for studying these interactions is the firn model SNOWPACK, which I use to simulate firn processes across ice sheets.

## Datasets, Tools, and Resources

#### SUMup ####
This [database](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi:10.18739/A24Q7QR58) contains millions of measurements of surface mass balance components from ice sheets and sea ice. The database contains four subdatasets: (1) snow and firn density on ice sheets, (2) accumulation rates on ice sheets, (3) 10-m borehole temperatures, and (4) snow depth on sea ice.

#### SUMMEDup2022 ####
This Python package is a tool for processing and plotting data from the SUMup database. I developed this tool with support from EarthCube. The [latest version](https://github.com/MeganTM/SUMMEDup2022) is compatible with the [latest SUMup release](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi:10.18739/A24Q7QR58).

#### SUMMEDup Tuturial ####
I led a portion of the EarthCube Learning Communities Fellowship tutorial where I demonstrated [SUMMEDup](https://github.com/MeganTM/SUMMEDup), which is a tool I developed to use with the SUMup dataset. Check out the slides [here](./EarthCube_tutorial.pdf), or watch the recorded tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/Mw8wfqEACKw?t=1293).

#### Icebergs on AntarcticGlaciers.org ####
Check out [this page](http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glacier-processes/glacier-types/icebergs/) about icebergs that I wrote for AntarcticGlaciers.org.

#### Icebergs on GlacierHub ####
I was interviewed about icebergs for the article, "How Does an Iceberg Really Float?", on _GlacierHub_. Read the article [here](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2021/03/12/iceberg-really-float/).

#### How do icebergs float? ####
Check out my tweet about how icebergs float [here](https://twitter.com/GlacialMeg/status/1362557149147058178) and be sure to try out Josh Tauberer's [Iceberger website](https://joshdata.me/iceberger.html) to draw an iceberg and see how it floats.
