## About Me

I am a recent graduate of the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences PhD program at the University of Colorado Boulder. I study firn processes on the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets and am interested in better understanding the interactions between the atmosphere and the surface of ice sheets. I use a combination of observations, remote sensing, and models to draw connections between climate and firn.

## Datasets, Tools, and Resources

#### SUMup ####
This [database](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi:10.18739/A24Q7QR58) contains millions of measurements of surface mass balance components from ice sheets and sea ice. The database contains four subdatasets: (1) snow and firn density on ice sheets, (2) accumulation rates on ice sheets, (3) 10-m borehole temperatures, and (4) snow depth on sea ice.

#### SUMMEDup2022 ####
This Python package is a tool for processing and plotting data from the SUMup database. I developed this tool with support from EarthCube. The [latest version](https://github.com/MeganTM/SUMMEDup2022) is compatible with the [latest SUMup release](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi:10.18739/A24Q7QR58).

#### SUMMEDup Tuturial ####
I led a portion of the EarthCube Learning Communities Fellowship tutorial where I demonstrated [SUMMEDup](https://github.com/MeganTM/SUMMEDup), which is a tool I developed to use with the SUMup dataset. Check out the slides [here](./EarthCube_tutorial.pdf), or watch the recorded tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/Mw8wfqEACKw?t=1293).

#### Icebergs on AntarcticGlaciers.org ####
Check out [this page](http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glacier-processes/glacier-types/icebergs/) about icebergs that I wrote for AntarcticGlaciers.org.

#### Icebergs on GlacierHub ####
I was interviewed about icebergs for the article, "How Does an Iceberg Really Float?", on _GlacierHub_. Read the article [here](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2021/03/12/iceberg-really-float/).

#### How do icebergs float? ####
Check out my tweet about how icebergs float [here](https://twitter.com/GlacialMeg/status/1362557149147058178) and be sure to try out Josh Tauberer's [Iceberger website](https://joshdata.me/iceberger.html) to draw an iceberg and see how it floats.
