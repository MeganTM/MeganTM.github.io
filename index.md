## About

Megan is a third-year PhD candidate in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. She has a master's degree in Geology from the University of Wyoming and dual bachelor's degrees in Geology and Environmental Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Megan studies firn processes on the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets and is interested in better understanding the interactions between the atmosphere and the surface of ice sheets. She uses a firn model, SNOWPACK, to simulate firn processes across ice sheets and compares the output to hundreds of firn density measurements from the SUMup database.

## Datasets, Tools, and Resources

#### SUMup ####
This [database](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi:10.18739/A24Q7QR58) contains millions of measurements of surface mass balance components from ice sheets and sea ice. The database contains four subdatasets: (1) snow and firn density on ice sheets, (2) accumulation rates on ice sheets, (3) 10-m borehole temperatures, and (4) snow depth on sea ice.

#### SUMMEDup2022 ####
This Python package is a tool for processing and plotting data from the SUMup database. Megan developed this tool with support from EarthCube. The [latest version](https://github.com/MeganTM/SUMMEDup2022) is compatible with the [latest SUMup release](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi:10.18739/A24Q7QR58).

#### SUMMEDup Tuturial ####
Megan led a portion of the EarthCube Learning Communities Fellowship tutorial where she demonstrated [SUMMEDup](https://github.com/MeganTM/SUMMEDup), which is a tool she developed to use with the SUMup dataset. Check out the slides [here](./EarthCube_tutorial.pdf), or watch the recorded tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/Mw8wfqEACKw?t=1293).

#### Icebergs on AntarcticGlaciers.org ####
Check out [this page](http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glacier-processes/glacier-types/icebergs/) about icebergs that Megan wrote for AntarcticGlaciers.org.

#### Icebergs on GlacierHub ####
Megan was interviewed about icebergs for the article, "How Does an Iceberg Really Float?", on _GlacierHub_. Read the article [here](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2021/03/12/iceberg-really-float/).

#### How do icebergs float? ####
Check out Megan's tweet about how icebergs float [here](https://twitter.com/GlacialMeg/status/1362557149147058178) and be sure to try out Josh Tauberer's [Iceberger website](https://joshdata.me/iceberger.html) to draw an iceberg and see how it floats.
