## About

Megan is a second-year PhD student in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. She holds a master's degree in Geology from the University of Wyoming and dual bachelor's degrees in Geology and Environmental Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Megan studies firn processes on the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets and is interested in better understanding the interactions between the atmosphere and the surface of ice sheets.

## Tools and Resources

#### [SUMup](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi%3A10.18739%2FA2W950P44) ####
This database contains millions of measurements of surface mass balance components from ice sheets and sea ice. The database contains four subdatasets: (1) snow and firn density on ice sheets, (2) accumulation rates on ice sheets, (3) 10-m borehold temperatures, and (4) snow depth on sea ice. Megan is leading an effort to release an updated and expanded version of SUMup in 2022.

#### [SUMMEDup](https://github.com/MeganTM/SUMMEDup) ####
This Python package is a tool for downloading, processing, and plotting data from the SUMup database. Megan developed this tool with support from EarthCube. 

## News
